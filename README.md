It is a example to use PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, MySQL to build a website.

I hope You can learn how to build a MVC structure website by yourself from this example.
I write the codes of login, register and go shopping in this example, however if you want to implement other logical parts, try it by yourself,
I believe you will figure it out.

If you have any questions, welcome to contact me via: yangyang01011001@gmail.com
